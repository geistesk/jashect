# jashect
**Just Another Simplified Hurricane Electric Certification Tool** to pass the *daily tests* for your *HE.net IPv6 Certification*

## What?
Some people aren't happy enough with being a sage and are always dreaming about reaching the 1.5k points… but are just too lazy to submit a report every day.

What am I talking about? The glorious [IPv6 Certification](https://ipv6.he.net/certification/) where you have to fill daily tests 100 times to count yourself as one of the best. And exactly there is this tiny script for.

This software was inspired by [HECT](https://github.com/tactmaster/HECT).


## Test
Your system should have installed binaries of `traceroute`, `dig`, `whois` and `ping6` or a new `ping`-version with the `-6` flag.

At first you should execute the script once in your shell and check if it's working for you (*works for me*™).

```bash
chmod +x jashect.sh
./jashect.sh username password
```


## Install
### systemd
If you're running a GNU/Linux with systemd I wrote the services for you.

```bash
# cp jashect.sh /usr/local/bin/jashect
# chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jashect
# cp -r systemd/* /usr/lib/systemd/system
```

Now modify the content of `/usr/lib/systemd/system/jashect.service.d/local.conf`

```bash
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl start jashect.timer
# systemctl enable jashect.timer
```

There you go! You don't have to worry for the next 100 days. Maybe you want to disable the script after reaching 1.5k points because it has no brakes…

### everything else
You could write a daily cronjob but it may fail because sometimes the script takes 5secs and sometimes 10secs. So you won't wait exactly 24 hours and your submission was rejected.. So perhaps it's a good idea to write two cronjobs separated for 12h or something like that.
